# Why I made this:
Many people have asked me about how to set up a minecraft server at home. Because i dont want to always guide them through the entire setup process, I got the idea to set up a guide for them so they can just follow the guide and learn it that way.

# What you will learn:
In this guide, you will learn how to set up a paper 1.12.2 server and forward the port over portmap or ngrok.
